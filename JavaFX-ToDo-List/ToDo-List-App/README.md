This To-Do List App was created using JavaFX with the ability to add and delete new To-Do list items. It also allows the user to categorize items by School, Work, Errands, Personal etc. The user is also able to set task deadlines using the calendar button as well as mark items as "COMPLETE" when a task is finished, but can also change it back to "INCOMPLETE" if needed. 

Using the Java io.Printscanner with an ArrayList, you'll be able to save your To-Do List to your computer and then load them back onto the app at any time.
